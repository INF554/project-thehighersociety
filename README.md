### PROJECT DESCRIPTION

The project presents a demographic study of the world population over the years. We have presented our analysis of 4 major topics using interactive graphs and charts. These topics are Age Distribution, Dependency Ratio, Employment Distribution and Gross Domestic Product. The analysis of these topics are presented for the 10 most populous countries in the world like US, India and China by leveraging charts like area chart, grouped bar chart, radial chart and world map. The datasets we used were fetched from the UN Data [website](https://population.un.org/) and were enough to show overall and individual statistics.
